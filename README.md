## üìñ Usage

1. Run the GUI application:
   ```powershell
   python main.py
   ```
2. Select the input source (Media Device, RTSP, Video File, Image File).
3. Choose or load a YOLO model (`.pt` file).
4. Adjust detection settings (confidence and NMS thresholds).
5. Start detection. Results and statistics will be displayed in the GUI.
6. Export statistics as needed.

### üñº View Saved Annotated Images

* All annotated detection results (from image or folder processing) are automatically saved in the `photo` folder inside your project directory.
* To view saved images:
  - Use the "Open Photo Folder" button in the right panel of the GUI, or
  - Manually open the `photo` folder in Windows Explorer.
* Each processed image is saved as `<image_name>` in `photo`.
* For folder processing, results are saved in subfolders named after the source folder.

### üìÅ View Model and Stats Folders

* The `model` folder contains your YOLO model files (`.pt`).
  - Use the "Open Model Folder" button in the GUI, or manually open the `model` folder to manage your models.
* The `stats` folder contains exported detection statistics (e.g., JSON files).
  - Use the "Open Stats Folder" button in the GUI, or manually open the `stats` folder to view or export statistics.

Each feature is self-contained and guides you with prompts specific to its task.
